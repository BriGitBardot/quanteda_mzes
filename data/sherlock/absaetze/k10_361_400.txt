"F.
H.
M.  Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing.
"You really are very fine indeed.
Let me see it."
He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.
"This is indeed important," said he.
"Ha!
you find it so?"
"Extremely so.
I congratulate you warmly."
Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look.
"Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
"On the contrary, this is the right side."
"The right side?
You're mad!
Here is the note written in pencil over here."
"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."
"There's nothing in it.
I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
"Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s.,       lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.
I see nothing in that."
"Very likely not.
It is most important, all the same.
As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."
"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising.
"I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first."
He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.
"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter.
Lady St. Simon is a myth.
There is not, and there never has been, any such person."
Lestrade looked sadly at my companion.
Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat.
"There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so l think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."
It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box.
This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.
