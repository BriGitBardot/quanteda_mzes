Ha, ha!
What have we here?
Tiptoes!
tiptoes!
Square, too, quite unusual boots!
They come, they go, they come again -- of course that was for the cloak.
Now where did they come from?"
He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.
Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.
For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.
A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained.
Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner.
"I fancy that this gray house on the right must be the lodge.
I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note.
Having done that, we may drive back to our lunchebn.
You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
"The murder was done with it."
"I see no marks."
"There are none."
"How do you know, then?"
"The grass was growing under it.
It had only lain there a few days.
There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken.
It corresponds with the injuries.
There is no sign of any other weapon."
"And the murderer?''
"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian ci- gars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket.
There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
Lestrade laughed.
"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said.
"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."
"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly.
"You work your own method, and I shall work mine.
I shall be busy this after- noon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
"And leave your case unfinished?"
"No, finished."
"But the mystery?"
