There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
"This is a very deep business," he said at last.
"There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.
Yet we have not a moment to lose.
If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.
It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.
We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
"Excellent.
You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
"By no means."
"Then we shall both come.
What are you going to do yourself?"
"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.
But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
"And you may expect us early in the afternoon.
I have myself some small business matters to attend to.
Will you not wait and breakfast?"
"No, I must go.
My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.
I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon."
She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.
"And what do you think of it all, Watson?"
asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.
"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
"Dark enough and sinister enough."
"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impass- able, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."
"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
"I cannot think."
"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the pres- ence of a band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
"But what, then, did the gypsies do?"
"I cannot imagine."
"I see many objections to any such theory."
"And so do I.
It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.
I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.
But what in the name of the devil!"
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.
His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.
So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the- doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.
