But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it.
The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."
"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever lis- tened.
Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide."
"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883.
His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2d."
"Thank you.
Pray proceed."
"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up.
We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed.
On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K.
K.
K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw.
For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America.
Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.

On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table.
There he was, sitting with a newly opened enve- lope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one.
He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.
" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?'
he stammered.
"My heart had turned to lead.
'It is K.
K.
K.,' said I.
"He looked inside the envelope.
'So it is,' he cried.
'Here are the very letters.
But what is this written above them?'
" 'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.
" 'What papers?
What sundial?'
he asked.
" 'The sundial in the garden.
There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.'
" 'Pooh!'
said he, gripping hard at his courage.
'We are in a civilized land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
