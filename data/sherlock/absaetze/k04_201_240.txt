Why, bless my soul!
here is her carriage at the door."
He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life.
Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpower- ing excitement and concern.
"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!"
she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come.
I have driven down to tell you so.
I know that James didn't do it.
I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too.
Never let yourself doubt upon that point.
We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly.
Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
"But you have read the evidence.
You have formed some conclusion?
Do you not see some loophole, some flaw?
Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"
"I think that it is very probable."
"There, now!"
she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade.
"You hear!
He gives me hopes."
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.
"I am afraid that my col- league has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
"But he is right.
Oh!
I know that he is right.
James never did it.
And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."
"In what way?"
asked Holmes.
"It is no time for me to hide anything.
James and his father had many disagreements about me.
Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us.
James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and -- and -- well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.
So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
"And your father?"
asked Holmes.
"Was he in favour of such a union?"
