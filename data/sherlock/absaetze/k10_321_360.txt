"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?"
he asked.
"Why?
What do you mean?"
"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."
Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion.
"I suppose you know all about it," he snarled.
"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
"Oh, indeed!
Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the maner?"
"I think it very unlikely."
"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?"
He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.
"There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile.
"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."
"Oh, indeed!"
said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
"No.
They were found floating near the margin by a park- keeper.
They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe.
And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"
"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disap- pearance."
"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
"Are you, indeed, now?"
cried Lestrade with some bitter- ness.
"I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences.
You have made two blun- ders in as many minutes.
This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
"And how?"
"In the dress is a pocket.
In the pocket is a card-case.
In the card-case is a note.
And here is the very note."
He slapped it down upon the table in front of him.
"Listen to this:          "You will see me when all is ready.
Come at once.
