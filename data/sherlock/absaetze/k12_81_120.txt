If you have not, you are not fined for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.
But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?
Your salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'
"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true.
The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man.
As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.
" 'May I ask where you live, sir?'
said I.
" 'Hampshire.
Charming rural place.
The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester.
It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
" 'And my duties, sir?
I should be glad to know what they would be.'
" 'One child -- one dear little romper just six years old.
Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper!
Smack!
smack!
smack!
Three gone before you could wink!'

"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'
" 'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried.
'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.
You see no difficulty, heh?'
" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
" 'Quite so.
In dress now, for example.
We are faddy people, you know -- faddy but kind-hearted.
If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
Heh?'
" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'
" 'Oh, no.'
" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
"I could hardly believe my ears.
As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
